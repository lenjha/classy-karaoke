ADDING A NEW ACTION
1) Write test for action inside of the test for the corresponding reducer
    Return initial state only, then the second test
2) Export constant from actiontypes that is like this: CHANGE_IMAGE
3) In actions index.js, export function like this: changeImage
        This is where the logic is written
4) In reducer, add action as a case in the switch statement
        look into "action.arg"
5) Return 1 to 4 until test passes
6) Import function from actions to component where the action is dispatched
7) Dispatch the action
